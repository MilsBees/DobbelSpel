# DobbelSpel

Progress:
At the moment it's possible to roll one die in the UI. 

Next steps:
Roll all five dice.

How: 
Make a map of the five dice with key as die1, die2, etc and the value being the rolled amount.
Then you can make a for each statement that rolls each dice and updates the image alongside it. 
Need to find a way to store imageIds in a variable so there's no repeat code. Perhaps by iterating through the map, but if this can be done by variable it's cleaner
